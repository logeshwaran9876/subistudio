She has gone above and beyond to not only make me and my fiancÃ© feel special and have her full attention, but to also be available to me at any time. From the moment I chose her, she has gone out of her way to invest in my wedding and life in general so she can help make my life easier. She also has so many ideas to help with ALL weddings/situations, and always has an answer to my problems/ dilemmas. I would HIGHLY recommend Janice as your wedding planner and I promise you will NOT be disappointed. This woman deserves a halo!! My wedding angel ðŸ˜‡. She is worth so much more than she charges! If you are on the fence between choosing a wedding planner, all I can say is....Book her! Book her! Book her!",

There were times when I wanted to give up, (it was especially difficult planning a wedding during the pandemic), but Janice was always very positive & gave me hope that I could have 'my' wedding day as I had always envisioned. And she was right! Her ideas, positivity, enthusiasm and help is just what I needed! The day of my wedding she went around checking on all my guests during the reception which I didn't expect but thought was great. I even received compliments from my guests on how nice and great they thought she was. I feel she went above & beyond what I paid for and highly recommend her to any bride out there who needs help having a fabulous wedding day!",
